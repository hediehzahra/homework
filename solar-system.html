                Our solar system is made up of a star, eight planets, and 
                <br> countless smaller bodies such as dwarf planets, asteroids, and comets.Our solar
                <br> system orbits the center of the Milky Way galaxy at about 515,000 
                <br> mph (828,000 kph). We're in one of the galaxy's four spiral arms.

                If you were to look at a giant picture of space, zoom in on the Milky Way galaxy,
                <br> and then zoom in again on one of its outer spiral arms, you’d find the solar system.
                <br> Astronomers believe it formed about 4.5 billion years ago, when a massive interstellar
                <br> cloud of gas and dust collapsed on itself, giving rise to the star that anchors our solar system
                <br> that big ball of warmth known as the sun.

                Along with the sun, our cosmic neighborhood includes the eight major planets.
                <br> The closest to the sun is Mercury, followed by Venus, Earth, and Mars. 
                <br> These are known as terrestrial planets, because they’re solid and rocky.
                <br> Beyond the orbit of Mars, you’ll find the main asteroid belt, a region
                <br> of space rocks left over from the formation of the planets. 
                <br> Next come the much bigger gas giants Jupiter and Saturn, which
                <br> is known for its large ring systems made of ice, rock, or both.
                <br> Farther out are the ice giants Uranus and Neptune.
                <br> Beyond that, a host of smaller icy worlds congregate in an enormous
                <br> stretch of space called the Kuiper Belt. Perhaps the most famous 
                <br> resident there is Pluto. Once considered the ninth planet,
                <br> Pluto is now officially classified as a dwarf planet, along
                <br> with three other Kuiper Belt objects and Ceres in the asteroid belt.

                   <h2> Moons and other matter</h2>
                   More than 150 moons orbit worlds in our solar system. Known as natural 
                   <br> satellites, they orbit planets, dwarf planets, asteroids, and other debris.
                   <br> Among the planets, moons are more common in the outer reaches of the solar system.
                   <br> Mercury and Venus are moon-free, Mars has two small moons, and Earth has just one.
                   <br> Meanwhile, Jupiter and Saturn have dozens, and Uranus and Neptune each have more
                   <br> than 10. Even though it’s relatively small, Pluto has five moons, one of which is
                   <br> so close to Pluto in size that some astronomers argue Pluto and this moon,
                   <br> Charon, are a binary system.
